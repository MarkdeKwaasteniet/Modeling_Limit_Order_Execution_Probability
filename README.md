This repository contains the data analysis done for my thesis: Limit Order Execution Probability Modeling in the Crypto-Asset Market.

Most of the analysis is done in a Jupyter Notebook file whilst calling function from an additional Python file.
The main reason being that this analysis is only to be done once properly and is not meant as a continuous project. 
This explains the lack of structure in this repository and the large amount of code in one file as this proved to be most efficient when having a lot of iterations done during the analysis.
